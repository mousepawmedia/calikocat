##### PATH CONFIGURATIONS ######
#
# Make a copy of this file and save it in the root of the repository
# with a name ending in ".config". Then modify as necessary.
#
# The repository is configured to ignore all .config files, with the
# exception of default.config (which should never be modified).
#
# ${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY} is a special variable which points to
# either the 'library/' or 'tester/' folder, depending on which one is
# being built. Relative paths should always begin with this variable,
# and should be relative to either of those folders.
#
# To use a configuration file with make, specify it in the 'make' command via
# "make <target> CONFIG=<name>", where '<name>' is the first part of the
# file name (before the .config). For example, "make library CONFIG=foo"
# would build the library (release target) using "foo.config".
#
# To use a configuration file with CMake directly, specify it by passing the
# argument "-DCONFIG_FILENAME=<name>", where '<name>' is the first part of the
# file name (before the .config). For example, passing the argument
# "-DCONFIG_FILENAME=foo" would build using "foo.config".

##### THIRD-PARTY DEPENDENCIES #####
#
# This sets the path to CPGF, Eigen, Opus, and pugixml.
# The build system will look for `lib/` and `include/' at this location.
#
# The default for all is '${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/../../libdeps/libs', which
# assumes a copy of the libdeps repository in the same directory as this
# repository folder.
#
# 'make <library>' or 'make all' would need to be run in libdeps first.

set(CPGF_DIR
	${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/../../libdeps/libs
)

set(EIGEN_DIR
	${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/../../libdeps/libs
)

##### PAWLIB #####
#
# This sets the path to PawLIB.
# The build system will look for 'lib/' and 'include/' at this location.
#
# The default is '${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/../../pawlib/pawlib', which
# assumes a copy of the pawlib git repository in the same directory as this
# repository folder.
#
# 'make ready' would need to be run in that repository to generate the
# library.

set(PAWLIB_DIR
	${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/../../pawlib/pawlib
)
